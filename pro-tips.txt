Should add this to the readme eventually, but this is a quick way to spit out ideas, isssues, quick tips, reminders AND STUFF while keeping writing informal


TODO & Ideas;

projects
-- Montitor and manage all projects, show user count etc
-- Running costs; calculate each projects running cost and profit.

my finances:

-- networth tracker: webscrapers, apis etc to track live networth + future projections?

* stocks
--

* Crypto
-- DripDrip; api, Interact & future projections
-- Arbitrage; only display data and opportunity, no executions needed.


* Other
-- Backups route; create a route purely for random and unique "backup" related processes, example: a backup for all .env files, automate fetching all .env files from project files and move them to the backup drive with versioning etc etc
-- Config editor; fetch configs from all projects on local server as a quick way to modify and save them from this app.
